# Capstone Lavender Acres

This is my final project for the Rasmussen Computer Science Capstone. The assignment was to create a web application and connect it to a database. We must also configure the Azure environment where the database will be hosted and create a simple database. The application can be hosted in any way that we have available to us. The application can be in any language.

# The Basic Requirements

* The app badge/icon
* The app's initial home screen when launched, complete with basic company information, logo, and login fields (username, password)
* A properly configured database for user accounts, with a minimum of 5 user accounts set up and fully functioning
* A minimum of 3 app screens (accessed after login) for users to access client information appropriate to the company (such as "About Us" or "Services" or "Current Orders")
* A properly functioning Sign Out button, available on all pages
* A screen confirming successful sign out.
* I am still learning how to code so I adapted code from [this tutorial page](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/php-tutorial/php-mysql-login-system.php). It was actually really easy to implement. Most things are like pulling teeth for me at this point.

# Work for Module 3

* Two information pages were added to the site.
* I created a "More Information" page that gives information about the Lavender Acres website. It talks about the purpose of the site and where to obtain more information about essential oils.
* I also created a "Support" page to provide information about how to use the site and create a login account.

I reformatted a lot of the visual appearance and added footers to several of the pages. I also changed the size of the headers on some of the pages and worked at making the page display properly on an actual phone. There is a difference between what the page looks like with the Chrome developer tool's emulations of a phone and my actual phone.
