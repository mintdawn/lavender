# Capstone Lavender Acres

This is my final project for the Rasmussen Computer Science Capstone. The assignment was to create a web application and connect it to a database. We must also configure the Azure environment where the database will be hosted and create a simple database. The application can be hosted in any way that we have available to us. The application can be in any language.

# The Basic Requirements

* The app badge/icon
* The app's initial home screen when launched, complete with basic company information, logo, and login fields (username, password)
* A properly configured database for user accounts, with a minimum of 5 user accounts set up and fully functioning
* A minimum of 3 app screens (accessed after login) for users to access client information appropriate to the company (such as "About Us" or "Services" or "Current Orders")
* A properly functioning Sign Out button, available on all pages
* A screen confirming successful sign out.
